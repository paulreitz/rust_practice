# Rust Practice
This is a series of projects Intended to practice Rust. Since Rust has such a crazy learning curve, and since I'm coming from a UX background, I decided to do a bunch of UI apps. The UI library I'm using is Druid.

This list of projects was generated by ChatGPT - except for the first one. I added that to get a basic set up for a Druid app.

Here is the list:
* Hello World
* Todo List
* Weather App
* Note Taking App
* Expense Tracker
* Calculator
* Recipe Manager
* Timer/Stopwatch
* File Organizer
* RSS Reader
* Simple Drawing App
