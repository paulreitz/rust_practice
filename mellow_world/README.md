# Mellow World!
I don't even remember why, but years ago I decided that, instead of making "Hello, World" whenever I was learning something new, I would make "Mellow World!" instead. This has stuck with me since, and that's why this project has that name.

There are three main goals for this project:
* Display "Mellow World!" in a window (typical hello world app behavior)
* Have some sort of structure that can be used in more complex apps - make use of modules.
* Save the location and size of the window when the app is closed, and restore the window to that same size/position when opened again.
